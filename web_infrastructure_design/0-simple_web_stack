User → www.foobar.com → IP 8.8.8.8 → Server

One Server Web Infrastructure

1. Scenario:
A user opens a browser and types "www.foobar.com". This request is sent over the internet to retrieve a webpage.

2. Domain Name:
- foobar.com is the domain name.
- www.foobar.com is a subdomain.
- A DNS record of type A or CNAME is used.
- It points to the IP address 8.8.8.8, which is the server hosting the website.

3. Server:
- A server is a computer that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers (clients).
- This server has IP address 8.8.8.8 and contains:

   a. **Web Server (Nginx)**:
      - Handles incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests.
      - Serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS).
      - Forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

   b. **Application Server (e.g., PHP-FPM)**:
      - Executes backend code (e.g., PHP files).
      - Processes logic and sends results to the web server.

   c. **Application Files**:
      - Codebase for the website (HTML, PHP, JavaScript, etc.).

   d. **Database (MySQL)**:
      - Stores and manages data.
      - Responds to SQL queries from the application server.

4. Communication:
- The server and user’s browser communicate using the **HTTP** protocol over **TCP/IP**.

5. DNS Record:
- The `www` part in www.foobar.com is a **CNAME** or **A record**.
- Most often, `www` is a **CNAME** pointing to `foobar.com`, which is an A record pointing to `8.8.8.8`.

6. Problems with This Infrastructure:
- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**:
  If the server crashes, the whole website is unavailable.
  
- **Maintenance Downtime**:
  Restarting the server or web service for updates will cause temporary outage.
  
- **Scalability Issues**:
  The server can't handle a large number of requests or high traffic spikes.
  No load balancing or redundancy.
